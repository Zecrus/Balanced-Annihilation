# Balanced-Annihilation

List of changes I made:
1. Move destroyer to T2
2. Give support ship samson weapon, no depthcharge
3. Give corvette a weak depthcharge, so it can rush subs
4. Slight damage nerf to arm corvette, damage buff to core corvette, so that they are more even
5. Remove aa from scout, lower cost slightly
6. Lower cost of T2 shipyard (-500m)
7. Buff destroyer so that its useful in T2 (depthcharge replaced with torp)
8. Lower cruiser range, increase its health, lower its cost
9. Lower battleship health
10. Remove pirahna/shark
11. Increase reload time for serpent/leviathan
12. Give all amphib units torpedoes
13. Nerfed T2 sea AA
14. Updated some descriptions
15. Increased sub health by 50% and damage taken by 50% (so amphibs take 50% more damage)


Overall Goals:
1. Have AA and anti-sub naturally incorporated into other sea units
2. Have fleet compositions naturally evolve as the game goes on
3. Make T2 sea easier to get, and easier for T1 to fight against
4. Have T2 sea involve evolving fleets, instead of spamming 1 unit
5. Have land be able to interact with sea through amphib units
6. Make sure that sea doesn't have to build a ton of niche units as insurance against different angles of attack

1. Increased Core corvette cost by 10m
2. Decreased Arm and Core assault frigate movement by 5%, range by 10
3. Decreased Arm and Core sub costs by 20%, increased movement by 10%, decreased damage by 10%
4. Added Guardian/Punisher to T1 sea con buildlist, removed land airlab from lists
5. Improved Arm and Core Gun Platform health and dps by 10%
6. Increased Arm and Core support ship damage by 10%, reduced health by 10%
7. Removed destroyer from consul and freaker buildmenu, replaced with corvette and assault frigate
