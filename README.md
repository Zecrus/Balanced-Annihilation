# Balanced-Annihilation

List of changes I made:
1. Move destroyer to T2
2. Give support ship samson weapon, no depthcharge
3. Give corvette a weak depthcharge, so it can rush subs
4. Slight damage nerf to arm corvette, damage buff to core corvette, so that they are more even
5. Remove aa from scout, lower cost slightly
6. Lower cost of T2 shipyard (-500m)
7. Buff destroyer so that its useful in T2 (depthcharge replaced with torp), slight plasma damage increase
8. Lower cruiser range, increase its health, lower its cost
9. Lower battleship health ~25%
10. Remove pirahna/shark
11. Increase reload time for serpent/leviathan to 4, damage to 1000
12. Give all amphib units torpedoes
13. Nerfed T2 sea AA ships, flak has double reload now
14. Updated some descriptions
15. Increased sub health by 50% and damage taken by 50% (so amphibs take 50% more damage)


Overall Goals:
1. Have AA and anti-sub naturally incorporated into other sea units
2. Have fleet compositions naturally evolve as the game goes on
3. Make T2 sea easier to get, and easier for T1 to fight against
4. Have T2 sea involve evolving fleets, instead of spamming 1 unit
5. Have land be able to interact with sea through amphib units
6. Make sure that sea doesn't have to build a ton of niche units as insurance against different angles of attack

Changes in v6:
1. Increased Core corvette cost by 10m
2. Decreased Arm and Core assault frigate movement by 5%, range by 10
3. Decreased Arm and Core sub costs by 20%, increased movement by 10%, decreased damage by 10%
4. Added Guardian/Punisher to T1 sea con buildlist, removed land airlab from lists
5. Improved Arm and Core Gun Platform health and dps by 10%

3. Improve comm uw laser range 260->300, range same as land now.  
4. Floating radar cost 130m->110m, sonar range 1200->900
5. Arm destroyer torpedo has lower cooldown, lower damage (same # of shots to take down T1 sub)
6. Core destroyer torpedo damage against subs buffed (takes 2 shots to take down T1 sub instead of 3)
7. Reduced T1 sub damage ~10%, should kill T1 units in same # of shots but takes 1 more shot for comm and T2
8. Added sonar range 500 to advanced torpedo launchers
